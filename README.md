Youtube enabled some sort of A/B config that changes font size below videos down to 9pt! I don't know which A/B options it is so I simply enlarged font by myself.

I believe it is some sort of bug because font reacts to the system changes so it is not hardcoded like 10 years ago. So youtube has code looking like this `smallSystemFontSize - 2.0` where smallSystemFontSize equals 11pt thus final font equals 9pt.
